# Accessibility workshop

This repository consists of two examples.
1. How to setup a basic linter and run react-axe in your browser.
2. Showcase issues with automated accessibility test of an website. Basically running the examples from [Building the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect Lighthouse score](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/)

## Getting started

Install npm and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). And then run:

### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can then run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
